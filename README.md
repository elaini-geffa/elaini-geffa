ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Learn, Build & Contribute

I'm a junior Computer Science student at Virginia Tech passionate about developing practical, real-world software. I've deployed my own website using HTML, CSS, and AWS (check it out: [elainigeffa.com](https://elainigeffa.com)) and built a motivational calendar app that ranked #1 in a 200-person cohort for its design and functionality.

I'm driven by curiosity and problem-solving, especially in unfamiliar territory. I take initiative, adapt quickly, and continuously challenge myself to learn new technologies and deliver meaningful results.
